## ⚡ What I Actually Do

* Identify where operational processes break (delivery delays, no-shows, revenue leakage)
* Analyze large, imperfect datasets using Python & SQL
* Isolate the small set of issues causing most failures (80/20 analysis)
* Deliver clearly documented insights that reduce management overhead in remote teams

## 🚀 Selected Work

### 🏥 Medical Appointment No-Show Prediction

Analyzed **110k+ medical appointments** to identify drivers of patient absenteeism and built a **cost-sensitive ML model** to reduce missed appointments and operational waste.  
Focused on feature behavior, model evaluation trade-offs, and decision impact for healthcare operations.

### 📦 Logistics Performance Analysis

Identified a **“double loss”** where late deliveries increased freight costs by **12%** and dropped customer satisfaction to **2.56/5**.
Focused on São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro hubs to surface targeted, actionable operational fixes.
